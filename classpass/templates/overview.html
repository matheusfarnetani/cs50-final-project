      <h2>So, what this app is about?</h2>
      <p>This is an interface to make the data of a database more user-friedly to read. It displays tables and renders
        graphs for simple analyses.</p>

      <p>Currently it servers as a portal of data from a bigger system called 'classpass', that is a college's exercise.
        This exercise proposed to identify and create a technology system in the campus to solve any kind of problem
        and the idea 'classpass' was created as a security system to identify who is entering in the property of the
        college. The approach is to start using RFID Cards in every entrance and buildings and gradually turning the
        RFIDs into NFCs as the technology could be an stantard to every new phone.</p>

      <p>The work here was about architecting and developing the app that could display the data created from the
        system, but in this case, it was generated from 'populate.py'. As serving as a tool for the security, this app
        could help monitorate the flow of registers, see statics that could help improve the inner space of the college,
        as a reference of 'usage' of the space. For example, the college could see that, the course 'x' is the course
        that lesat use the library, so maybe it should ask the students the reasons for that or simply buying more books
        about the related topics.</p>
